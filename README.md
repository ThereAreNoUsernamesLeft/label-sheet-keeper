# Label Sheet Keeper for Word

A side panel for Microsoft Word that keeps track of which labels on a sheet are already used, so partly used sheets don't go to waste.

- The Word document **is** the label sheet. Type and format labels right in it.
- The panel shows a map of the sheet: used, ready to print, and open labels.
- Fill labels by copying one you typed, by placing an address (with a design), or from a table of many addresses.
- The panel notices when Word prints the sheet, marks those labels used (with Undo), and counts the sheet's trips through the printer.
- Everything about a sheet is saved inside its Word document, so it goes wherever the file goes.

## Label sizes

| Size | Labels | Fits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1″ × 2⅝″ | 30 per sheet | Avery 5160 (laser), 8160 (inkjet) |
| ½″ × 1¾″ | 80 per sheet | Avery 5167 (laser), 8167 (inkjet) |
| 2″ × 4″ | 10 per sheet | Avery 5163 (laser), 8163 (inkjet) |
| 3⅓″ × 4″ | 6 per sheet | Avery 5164 (laser), 8164 (inkjet) |
| 5½″ × 8½″, sideways page | 2 per sheet | Avery 5126 (laser), 8126 (inkjet) |
| 8½″ × 11″ | 1 per sheet | Avery 5165 (laser), 8165 (inkjet) |

Use the laser version of a label on a laser printer. You can add your own sizes in the panel (**Add your own size** when making a sheet) or in `formats.js`.

## One-time setup on a Mac

1. Download `manifest.xml` from this repository.
2. Quit Word.
3. In Finder, press **⌘⇧G** and go to `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/`
4. If there's no folder named `wef` there, make one (File › New Folder, name it `wef`).
5. Put `manifest.xml` inside `wef`.
6. Open Word and any document. On the **Home** tab, click **Label Sheet**. If you don't see it, click **Add-ins** on the Home tab and choose **Label Sheet Keeper**.

## Everyday use

Point at an **ⓘ** in the panel for a short explanation of that tool.

1. Click **Label Sheet**, choose your labels, and click **Make the sheet**. A new document opens with the panel. Save it, for example as `Labels 30 per sheet.docx`.
2. **Mark used labels:** click each label on the map that's already peeled off your sheet.
3. **Fill labels:**
   - **Copy:** type a label in the document, leave the cursor in it, and click **Copy** or **Fill every open label**. **Fit text** shrinks text that's too big (never below a readable size); labels whose text may be cut off get a red outline on the map.
   - **Address:** type an address or pick one from the dropdown, which lists your last ten addresses under **Recent** and then your address book. Choose a design (Plain, Bold name, Return to, With logo), and put it on the next open label or every open label. Under the address are **Phone** and **Email**, each with an **On label** box; ticked ones print under the address. A contact with a second address (like a PO box), phone or email shows those too, with **Address 1 / Address 2** to switch. What starts ticked comes from the sheet (**Use for this sheet**), unless the contact has its own choice (**Remember for …**, which also saves the phone and email you typed); unticking a box changes only the label you're placing. If text may be cut off once it's on a label, the panel says so and asks before shrinking it, never below a readable size. In the **Address book**, click a saved address to change it, add a second address, phones and emails, or put it in groups (like Family or Work); pick a group to see just its addresses and put the whole group on your open labels, each contact as remembered. **Import contacts** reads a file from the Mac Contacts app (.vcf), Google or Outlook (.csv) or Excel and lists who's in it; tick the ones to import. Someone already saved gets the details they were missing. The table window can add a whole group too.
   - **Table:** opens a bigger window like a small spreadsheet, with one row for each open label. The first column shows which label a row goes on. Type addresses, paste cells from Excel or Numbers, or open an Excel, CSV or contacts file. **On labels: Phone, Email** says whether those columns print (it starts from the sheet's choice); leave a row's phone or email empty to keep it off that label. Rows past your open labels are marked "New sheet"; **Fill labels** puts them on new sheets, each in its own window.
   - **Numbers:** numbers labels in order ("Box 1 of 12", "BIN-007"), with a QR code or a Code 128 barcode under each if you like. Numbering picks up where you left off on the next sheet.
4. **Print** with ⌘P at 100% scale. Feed the sheet top edge first, print side up, and choose **Labels** as the paper type. The panel notices the print and marks those labels used.

When you load a fresh sheet of labels, click **Reset for a fresh sheet**.

### Printing on partly used sheets

Avery says laser label sheets should go through a laser printer only once, because the heat softens the glue. Each extra trip raises the chance of a label peeling off inside the printer. The panel helps keep trips down:

- It counts each sheet's **trips** through the printer and warns before a second trip. You set the limit in **Settings** (3 to start).
- On a sheet's **last trip**, it offers to fill the remaining open labels (with your return address or copies of a label) so nothing goes to waste.
- Let several labels pile up as "ready to print," then print them in one trip.
- When a table or a set of copies doesn't fit on this sheet, and you have other part-used sheets of the same size, the panel offers to fill those first. It opens each one in turn; that sheet's panel fills its open labels and opens the next. Anything left goes on new sheets.
- Press down any lifted label edges before feeding a sheet, and retire a sheet with a peeling label.
- Under the label counts, **labels saved** counts the labels you've printed on partly used sheets instead of fresh ones (hover for about how many sheets that is). Turn it off in **Settings**; it keeps counting while hidden, so the number is right when you turn it back on. Undoing a print takes its labels off the count.

### Feed arrow

On sheets with a blank strip above the labels, the panel prints a small "▲ TOP · feed this edge into the printer first" in that strip, so you can tell which way a partly used sheet goes in. Turn it off in **Settings**.

### Test page and printer adjustment

With a new printer or a new pack of labels, click **Make a test page** and print it on scrap paper. Hold it behind a label sheet against a light. The panel then asks whether it lined up. If the boxes are off the same way every time, enter the shift in **Settings › Printer adjustment**. New sheets use it, and **Apply to this sheet** moves the labels on the sheet you have open.

If your printer has a scanner, the panel can measure the test page for you: scan the printed test page (the whole page, at 100%, any way up), then click **Use a scan** (after a test page, or in **Settings › Printer adjustment**) and choose the scan (PDF, PNG or JPEG). Test pages carry five small black squares near the corners; the panel finds them, says how far off the page printed, and offers the adjustment. This works for every size, including the sideways 2-per-sheet shipping labels. Test pages made before version 1.7 have no squares; for upright sizes the panel measures their boxes instead, and for sideways sizes it asks you to make a new test page.

### Shipping labels (2 per sheet and full sheet)

- **Label file:** choose an Amazon return label PDF or a picture of any label, drop it on the panel, or copy a label image and press ⌘V in the panel. The panel finds the label's printed border by itself; drag across the preview to change it. Then click **Put on the next open label**.
- **Several labels at once:** choose or drop several PDFs or pictures. Each label goes on a waiting list; **Put the next labels on this sheet** fills the open labels in order. After printing, load a fresh sheet and click it again. For one PDF with several labels, **Use every page** adds every page that has a label border.
- **Address:** fill in From and Ship to (or pick a saved address). Your return address is remembered.
- Print the test page once and tell the panel which half of your sheet Label 1 came out on; from then on it says "top label" and "bottom label."

### Send labels from your phone

In **Settings › Your phone**, click **Link your phone** and scan the QR code with your phone's camera. It opens a small sending page (`phone.html`): tap **Choose a label** to send a return-label PDF or screenshot. On an iPhone, the page also explains how to add a **Send to Label Sheet Keeper** shortcut to the Share button, so a label in Mail, Files or Photos is two taps away.

Labels you send show up on shipping-label sheets as "1 label from your phone." **Use it** opens the label like a chosen file (several go on the waiting list). Labels wait on the Label Sheet Keeper server (the Cloudflare Worker in `worker/`) until the panel picks them up, for 7 days at most, and are deleted from it once picked up. The phone only knows a sending address; reading labels takes a key that stays on your Mac (and out of backups). **Unlink** stops the sending address and deletes anything still waiting.

### Address suggestions

In the table window, type a house number and street, and the panel suggests matching US and Canadian addresses. Pick one to fill in the street, city, state or province, and ZIP or postal code. A ZIP code or postal code on its own also fills in the city (using the free Zippopotam.us service).

Suggestions come from [Photon by Komoot](https://photon.komoot.io/), a free service with no sign-up, using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) data. What you type is sent to Photon. Photon is shared by everyone, so it asks for light use, and some house numbers aren't in OpenStreetMap yet. Turn suggestions off in **Settings › Address suggestions**.

**Bring your own key (optional).** For your own daily allowance, use a free Geoapify key instead:

1. Sign up for a free account at [geoapify.com](https://www.geoapify.com/). No credit card is needed; the free plan includes 3,000 lookups a day.
2. Create a project and copy its API key.
3. In the key's settings, add `https://labelsheetkeeper.github.io` as an allowed origin (or HTTP referrer), so the key only works from this add-in.
4. In Word, open the panel, then **Settings › Address suggestions**. Paste the key and click **Save key**.

The key is kept by the panel on your Mac only, not in this repository or in your Word documents. With a key, suggestions go to Geoapify instead of Photon. On another Mac, paste the key there too.

### Canadian addresses

Canadian addresses follow Canada Post: `5-123 Main St` for a unit, and `Toronto ON  M5V 3L9` on the last line (two spaces before the postal code). Mail to Canada gets a `CANADA` line. If you mail from Canada, choose **Settings › You mail from › Canada**, and US addresses get a `USA` line instead.

### Label stock and reordering

Open **Label stock** on a sheet and enter how many sheets of those labels you have, how many come in a pack, and when to remind you. A sheet comes off the count the first time it goes through the printer (Undo puts it back). When you're running low, the Print step shows a reminder with **Reorder** and **I got a new pack**.

Paste a link to the labels you buy. **Reorder** then:

- **Amazon** (a product link with `/dp/` in it): adds the number of packs you chose to your Amazon cart, using Amazon's add-to-cart link (Amazon may ask you to confirm first).
- **Walmart** (a product link with `/ip/` in it): adds the packs to your Walmart cart.
- **Any other store** (Staples, Office Depot, Avery…): opens the product page; add the labels to your cart there.

Buy the kind made for your printer: laser labels (Avery 5160, 5126…) for a laser printer, inkjet labels (8160, 8126…) for an inkjet.

### Back up and restore settings

**Settings › Backup** (or **Back up or restore settings** in a document that isn't a sheet) makes a Word document holding your address book, return address, label sizes, printer adjustments, label stock and logo. Your Geoapify key is left out unless you tick **Include my Geoapify key**. Save the document somewhere safe; it holds your addresses, so keep it private.

To restore, open the backup in Word and click **Restore these settings**, or click **Restore from a file** in the panel and choose it. Restoring replaces the panel's settings on that Mac. Your label sheets are their own documents and aren't part of the backup.

### Your sheets

**Your sheets** lists every sheet with labels left, with open labels and trips used. When you make a new sheet in a size you already have, the panel asks whether to finish the old one first.

The list keeps itself tidy. A sheet that was never saved can't be reopened once it's closed, so it drops off by itself. A saved sheet that Word can't open any more (moved or deleted) comes off when you click **Open**; if you only moved it, open it in Word and it's listed again.

### Print history and undo

**Undo** under step 3 takes back the last "I printed these." Older prints can be undone from **Print history**, as long as their labels haven't been reset or marked again since. The labels become open again with their text back (the newest eight prints keep their text; pictures, such as shipping labels and QR codes, come back empty), and the trip count and label stock go back too.

### Repair

If the label layout gets damaged (a row deleted, text typed above the labels, a table pasted inside a label), the panel says so. **Repair this sheet** rebuilds the layout and keeps used labels and labels ready to print.

## Adding a new label size in formats.js

1. Open `formats.js` in this repository on GitHub and click the pencil icon to edit.
2. Copy one of the entries between `{` and `},`, paste it, and change the values. The comment at the top of the file explains each measurement.
3. Click **Commit changes**. GitHub runs the checks and, if they all pass, publishes the change in a few minutes.
4. In Word, open the panel and click **Make another sheet**. The new size is listed. Print a test page before using it on real labels.

## Updating the panel

All of the panel's code lives in this repository. Each commit to `main` is checked first (see `tests/README.md`); only when every check passes is it published, and Word picks up the new version the next time the panel opens (the panel loads its files with a fresh address each time). Changes to `taskpane.html` or `table.html` themselves can take up to 10 minutes to show, because GitHub lets Word keep a copy of those pages for that long. If a check fails, the commit gets a red ✗ on GitHub and the live panel stays as it was.

You only need to touch `manifest.xml` on your Mac again if the add-in's name or web address changes.

In version 1.7.1 the panel moved from `therearenousernamesleft.github.io` to `labelsheetkeeper.github.io`. The panel's saved settings belong to its web address, so after installing the new `manifest.xml`, restore them from a backup made before the move (**Settings › Backup**). Label sheets keep working, since they find the add-in by its ID.

The version Word shows under the add-in's Security Info comes from `manifest.xml`, which is bumped with each release. With the copy installed on your Mac, it changes only when you copy the new `manifest.xml` there. Once the add-in is deployed for others through the Microsoft 365 admin center, uploading the new manifest (**Integrated apps › Update**) updates it for everyone; Microsoft says that can take up to 72 hours to reach every user.
